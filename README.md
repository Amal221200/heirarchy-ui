# Hierarchuy UI

+ Hierarchy UI is an application build with React with TypeScript, in which the structure of the company's employees and shown in the form of a hierarchy, where you can also add, edit, delete the employees data.
+ I have used Tailwind CSS for styling, ShadCN UI for minimalistic and headless UI components, and zustand for sharing app data across the application.
+ It uses localstorage to store the data inside the clients browser.
